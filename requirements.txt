# Sampler Editor - Requirements v0.8 (CREPE + Amplitude Detection)

# GUI Framework
PySide6>=6.6.0

# Audio processing libraries
numpy>=1.24.0
soundfile>=0.12.1
sounddevice>=0.4.6
scipy>=1.10.0

# CREPE pitch detection (primary)
crepe>=0.0.13
tensorflow>=2.13.0

# Backup pitch detection
aubio>=0.4.9
librosa>=0.10.1

# File handling and utilities
pathlib2>=2.3.7; python_version<"3.4"

# Development and debugging
pytest>=7.4.0
pytest-qt>=4.2.0

# Installation notes:
# 1. Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt
# 2. For CPU-only TensorFlow (lighter):
#    pip install tensorflow-cpu>=2.13.0 instead of tensorflow
# 3. If you encounter TensorFlow/CREPE issues, try:
#    pip install --upgrade tensorflow==2.13.0
#    pip install --upgrade crepe==0.0.13
# 4. For Apple Silicon Macs:
#    pip install tensorflow-macos tensorflow-metal
# 5. CREPE requires TensorFlow but provides state-of-the-art pitch detection
# 6. Librosa and aubio serve as backup methods if CREPE fails
# 7. Minimum Python version: 3.8+

# Performance recommendations:
# - Use tensorflow-cpu for faster startup if no GPU available
# - CREPE 'medium' model provides good balance of speed/accuracy
# - For production: consider tensorflow-gpu if CUDA is available
# - Memory usage: ~1-2GB for TensorFlow + CREPE models

# Audio format support:
# - soundfile: WAV, FLAC, AIFF (fast, reliable)
# - librosa: MP3, OGG, M4A (slower but more formats)
# - Both libraries complement each other for maximum compatibility
